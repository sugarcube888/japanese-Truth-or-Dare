                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>This is a game that tests your friendship. There are five levels from <i>Just Friends</i> (not so close) to <i>Are You Guys Gay?</i> (the closest). Start at <i>Just Friends</i> and see how far you two can get. Remember, what happens during this game shall not be talked about after the game ends. What happens here, stays here.</p>
                <p><b>About Japanese Truth or Dare:</b> This game is like regular Truth or Dare except without the <i>truth</i> part. Only dares (called <i>batsu</i> in Japanese) are allowed. They are all written out for you aleady. In order to determine who will take the dare, you must play one round of some sort of competition. We recommend one round of Super Smash Brothers â€“ one stock, 250% damage. Loser of that round must take the dare.</p>
                <p>While alcohol dares are scattered throughout the board, you can skip them if you want. In fact, you can skip any dare on the board if you find it boring or just undoable. Remember, this is a test to see how close you are to your friend. See how far you can get down the board. The left-most column is the easiest level (Just Friends) while the dares get increasingly more difficult as you go to the right. Dares generally become more difficult as you go down a column. Therefore, the final dare at the right-most column on the bottom is considered the ultimate humiliation/embarassment for a man. (Look if you dare.)</p>
                <p>You can play sequentially, starting at the left-most column and go down each round. Alternatively, you can use a random number generator to pick a random number in the column and let that decide the dare each round. There are also group dares. In that case, you and your friend will do a team battle against two CPUs in Smash Bros. For group dares in column 1 (the left-most column), place both CPU enemies at level 5. For column 2, level 6. For column 3, level 7. For column 4, level 8. And for column 5, level 9.</p>
                <p>If you decide to use Smash Brothers as the competition of choice for each round, it is highly recommended that the loser of the last round be given some sort of handicap in the next round. For instance, both players play against one another and Player 2 loses. In the next round, Player 2 will form a 2-person team with a CPU at level 3. Player 1 (victor of the previous round) will have to fight against both enemies in the next round. Should Player 1 win the next round again, he will challenge Player 2 plus the CPU challenger again, except the CPU's level will go up to 5. If, however, Player 1 loses, then Player 2 drops the CPU helper and the competition returns to 1-v-1. Make adjustments accordingly to allow for everyone to experience the joys of Japanese Truth or Dare.</p>
                <p>If you want to skip or just ignore certain dares, simply click each card you wish to skip/ignore. To reset, reload this page.</p>
